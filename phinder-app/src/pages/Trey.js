Family: Trey was born in Fort Worth, TX and moved to Princeton, NJ in the summer of 1966. His mother, Dina, is an author and was editor of Sesame Street Magazine. Dina has written several stories and songs together with Trey. His father Ernest (“Ernie”) was the Executive Vice President of Educational Testing Services in Princeton, New Jersey, who administer the SAT and other aptitude tests. Trey's one sibling, sister Kristy, was an environmentalist and author of The Ecology of Place who directed the Phish Update newsletter before the creation of the Döniac Schvice; she passed away in 2009. Trey's dog Marley (who passed away 10/8/00) is featured on two of his guitars and toured with the band in the early days. (Phish's song publishing company, “Who Is She? Music” was named after Marley, and TPC2 was in part dedicated to him.) Trey married Susan Eliza Statesir on 8/13/94, with whom he has two daughters, Eliza Jean (b. 8/21/95) and Isabella (b. 4/22/97). He presently lives in Vermont.</p>
